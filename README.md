I'm Pascal, a Software Engineer from the East side of Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ with a strong passion for React and the JavaScript ecosystem at large. I love to learn and share as I go, this means I write technical content whenever I can.

ðŸŒ± I'm attempting to embrace continuous learning and growth, and I'm currently working to become a better version of myself.

ðŸ’¡ I am always interested in fun projects and activities.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding the concept of Web3, blockchain, NFT, DAOs
